### Changeblog

#### About
A changeblog is just somewhere for me to write thoughts while working on a project. Primarily for myself but maybe also useful/entertaining for anyone who might happen to read it. I did them a lot when working on projects for Hyperskill.

I've had my domain, brdlf.dev, redirecting to my github for a while. I really ought to have more of a "website" put together. I've only ever been given the basic rundown of webdev over a decade ago back in highschool. "Have an .html, .css, and MAYBE a .js in a folder"
Stuff's different now, after some scouring thil will be done with npm, bootstrap, sass & parcel. Maybe others. /
Since it's hosting through github pages it needs to be static, which limits be a bit. But the limitations will be goot to just learn. /
It's taken an embarrassing amount of time just getting the nav to work and link to other pages. There's no doubt a best practice i'm simply ignorant of, but I can learn over time. Right now I just want to make: /
1. A simple homepage with an about and contact section, viewable and navicable without any JS. /
2. A "portfolio" page with, idk. Silly little tools or games or what have you, links to other projects I've done. Etc.

Jeez speaking of, I should really work on more silly little projects. I did a lot more when I was in school....

I had some guests in from out of town, completely sidetracked me from my goal of "finish the darn site already, abby." I played around with bootstrap some more, something really frustrating was happening. /
The built in example of "light gray background" wasn't working on my site. I tried different versions of bootstrap, I tried manually editing the color to somethng new and the new color registered, but not the "light gray." /
I hate to admit it, but the reason was my screen not being calibrated correctly... so there goes a few hours of time down the drain! Oh well, a valuable lesson nonetheless.

Today, I plan on just filling the site with content, at least the "about me" and "contact" section. Just so it'll feel like something got done. I can do silly JS things over the weekend.

I've been on vacation this week, forgot that I still haven't finished just the barebones. That's going to happen TODAY.
